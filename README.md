Evaluating all equity funds in the Brazilian Stock Exchange to look for unexpected returns

## Intro

The idea for this analysis came from a conversation with a few friends about how the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) could be rejected empirically. While there is a vast literature on this topic, I wanted to devise a simple test that could show whether some equity funds were able to achieve unlikely excessive returns consistently. This is an interesting debate for personal investors like me because if the EMH holds, then passive investing by holding onto ETFs should always be preferred over buying specific investment funds and paying performance and management fees. 

## Theory

EMH postulates that consistent generation of alpha (excess return) is impossible. Here we define alpha according the Capital Pricing Model (CAPM) as the difference between the expected return of a portfolio given its risk (variance of monthly returns) and the risk free rate (SELIC rate in the Brazilian stock market).

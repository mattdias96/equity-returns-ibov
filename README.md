Evaluating all equity funds in the Brazilian Stock Exchange to look for unexpected returns

## Intro

The idea for this analysis came from a conversation with a few friends about how the Efficient Market Hypothesis could be rejected empirically. While there is a vast literature on this topic, I wanted to devise a simple test that could show whether some equity funds were able to achieve unlikely excessive returns consistently. 

## Theory

The Effiient Market Hypothesis (EMH) postulates that consistent generation of alpha (excess return) is impossible. Here we define alpha according the Capital Pricing Model (CAPM)
